## Analysis of International Debt Statistics
The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives.
In this project, I have analyzed the World Bank dataset by writing SQL queries to answer interesting questions about international debt. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories as recorded from 1970 to 2015. This analysis can be used to find the answers to questions like:

* What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
* Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
* What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank (https://www.worldbank.org/en/home). It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe.
